4
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,718
You're from Baker?

5
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,523
Tell Baker that
I told him all
that I know already.

6
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,233
Tell him I want
to live in peace,
understand?

7
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,236
There is no use to
go on tormenting me!

8
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,156
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

9
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,699
Now that gold
has disappeared,
but if he'd listened,

10
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,910
we could have
avoided this altogether.

11
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,246
I went to the army court.

12
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,040
There were no witnesses.

13
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,459
They couldn't
uncover any more.

14
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,462
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

15
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,047
Go back and tell him that.

16
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,718
Word's around
you had a visitor,

17
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,305
and Baker knows it.

18
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,226
Name of Jackson.

19
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,233
Well, Jackson was here

20
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,278
or Baker's got it all wrong.

21
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,871
He's not wrong.

22
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,416
Maybe Baker
would like to know

23
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,544
just what you and
Jackson had to say

24
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,504
about the cash box.

25
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,552
That's not what
I'm being paid for.

26
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,810
I'm only interested in
what name Jackson's
hiding under now.

27
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,150
Why do you think
Jackson may be
assuming another name?

28
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,901
I would have
found him already.

29
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,822
When I start off
to find somebody,
I find him.

30
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,241
That's why they pay me.

31
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,999
What is Baker paying you?

32
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,837
That your family?

33
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,307
Yes.

34
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,267
(CHUCKLES)
Nice family.

35
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,606
What does he pay
you for murdering me?

36
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,903
$500

37
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,988
to get the name.

38
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,788
The name.

39
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,050
Carson. Bill Carson.

40
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,053
That's what
he calls himself now.

41
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,586
That's a lot of money. $1 ,000.

42
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,300
$1 ,000?

43
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,431
And some in gold.
That's a tidy sum.

44
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,190
But when I'm paid,
I always see the job through.

45

46
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,389
It's you.

47
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,516
Any information?

48
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,187
Too much.

49
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,691
He said quite a bit
that should interest you,

50
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,527
and one or two
things that interested me.

51
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,862
Such as?

52
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,450
The name Jackson's
hiding under is Bill Carson.

53
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,285
Ah.

54
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,163
That's your bit.

55
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,042
Keep talking.

56
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:06,005
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box,

57
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,882
which just
happened to disappear.

58
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,010
That's my bit.

59
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,595
Anything else?

60
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,681
Not enough for you, eh?

61
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,767
Well, you don't have to worry.

62
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,560
He'll never say
anything to anybody again.

63
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,146
Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect.

67

00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,328
Yeah. I almost forgot.

70
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,163
He gave me $1 ,000.

71
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,417
I think his idea
was that I kill you.

told me the last time?

478
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,911
"If you save your breath,
I feel a man like
you could manage it."

479
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:07,251
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die, only slowly,

480
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,129
very slowly, old friend.

481
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,971
After you, please.
Start walking.

482
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,381
Taking a rest?

483
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,009
Come on, Blondie.
We don't have
very far to go.

484
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,928
Only 70 miles.

485
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:27,265
Only eight-and-a-half hours
more before sunset.

486
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,685
That's not too bad.

487
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,646
Come on.

488
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,409
(LAUGHING)

489
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,383
Okay, let's eat.

490
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,969
That is, I'll eat.

491
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,180
Hmm?

492
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,309
Meanwhile, you can
enjoy a sunbath.

493
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,445
You want some water?

494
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,785
Drink. Drink.

495
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,209
Come on. Come on.

496
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,795
Well, Blondie. So long.

497
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,239
And so, Blondie,

498
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,243
it's goodbye.

499
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,332
(RUMBLING)

500
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,303
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Whoa, boy.

501
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,476
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

502
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,687
Attaboy. That's nice.

503
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:37,797
Water. Water.

504
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,972
$200,000 in gold.

505
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,807
It's yours.
Just get me water.

506
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,606
What's that you say?

507
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,774
Who the hell are you?

508
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,151
Carson.

509
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,946
My name is
Bill Carson now.
It's Carson.

510
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,073
Surprise attack.

511
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:09,704
All dead. My name is
Jackson, not Carson.

512
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:12,081
Carson, Carson, yeah, yeah.
Glad to meet you, Carson.

513
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,919
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What was that you
said about the dollars?

514
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,795
$200,000, all mine.

515
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,132
Was the Third Cavalry's.

516
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,469
Baker has nothing.

517
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:29,057
The gold, I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

518
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:33,686
Where? Where, here?
Here? Talk.

519
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,356
In the cemetery.

520
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,067
Which cemetery?

521
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:41,778
The one on Sad Hill.

522
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,198
There's a grave by. . .

523
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:49,744
Which grave?
Have a name?
Have a number?

524
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:52,288
Come on, you dummy, talk.

525
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:57,752
There's no number.
There's a name.

526
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,964
It's written. . .

527
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,257
Yes?

528
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,009
(CHOKING)

529
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:09,555
Water.

530
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,936
You talk first, huh?
I'll give you water later.

531
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,688
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.

532
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,022
In the grave. Okay.

533
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,566
But it must have a name
or a number on it, huh?

534
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,152
There must be a
thousand, five thousand.

535
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,617
Don't die, huh?

536
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,577
Don't die.
I'll get you water.

537
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:35,498
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

538
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:38,209
Don't die until later,
you son of a. . .

539
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:01,566
(SCREAMS)

540
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,236
Get away from there.

541
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,785
He's dead.

542
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:13,911
Yeah.

543
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,249
I'll kill you.

544
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:24,172
If you do that,
you'll always be poor,

545
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,925
just like the greasy
rat that you are.

546
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:33,181
If I were you,
I'd keep me alive.

547
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,517
What did he tell you, huh?

548
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,769
A name.

549
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,521
A name on a grave.

550
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,648
What name?

551
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,706
Blondie, don't die.

552
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:02,210
Blondie, don't die.
I'm your friend.

553
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,544
Please don't die. Please.

554
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,797
I'm your friend.
Come on. Come on.

555
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,467
Blondie.

556
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,386
I'll help you.
I'll help you.

557
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,221
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

558
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:16,557
Here's the water.
Don't die like that pig.

559
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:20,561
Hey, Blondie,
here's water.
Water, Blondie.

560
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,563
Don't drink, don't drink.
Is no good for you.

561
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,399
Feel better?

562
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,484
Blondie,
what's the matter?

563
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,236
Please, don't die.

564
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,373
TUCO: Hey, open up!
Open up! Hurry!

565
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:43,209
Settle down.
Settle down.
Who's there?

566
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:48,506
What do you mean,
"Who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

567
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,304
If I were a Yankee,
you wouldn't have
time to ask me that.

568
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,722
Come on.

569
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:59,517
Sergeant, listen to
this corporal for a moment.

570
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,601
Yes, sir.

571
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,604
Sergeant,
I have a gravely
wounded man here,

572
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,857
if he's not dead already.

573
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,860
He's still alive?

574
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,528
Well, he seems to be.

575
01:14:12,322 --> 01:14:13,948
What happened?
It was a trap.

576
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,658
Only the two
of us got away.

577
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,493
Name and traveling papers.

578
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:24,041
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
Third Regiment,
2nd Cavalry Squadron,

579
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,794
arriving from San Rafael.
Is that enough?

580
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,719
Are you reading
when this man is dying?

581
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,054
Why, Corporal,
we're trying to withdraw

582
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,140
and you're looking
for an infirmary?

583
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:42,226
If you want one, you'll
have to make yourself
a Yankee prisoner.

584
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:43,352
(ALL LAUGHING)

585
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,188
So where are we?

586
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,856
Near Apache Canyon.

587
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,817
Apache Canyon?

588
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:50,985
Apache Canyon.

589
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,488
Is a Mission San Antonio
around here?

590
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,948
Sure, 1 8 miles south.
Take him there.

591
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,825
The brothers take care
of anyone who's wounded,

592
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,827
no matter what
the color of his uniform.

593
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,580
And keep your eyes open,
the area is full of Yankees.

594
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,415
Thank you.
Goodbye, Sergeant.

595
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,750
Take care.

596
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:31,776
I've got a very
sick man here.

597
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,361
But we have no
more beds here.

598
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:34,779
Let him have yours.

599
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,203
Where's Pablo Ramirez?

600
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,329
Father Ramirez.

601
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:47,750
He's away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.

602
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,210
Well, it doesn't matter.

603
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,213
For the moment,
we take very good
care of my friend.

604
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,048
And may God be praised.

605
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,509
In case you didn't know it,
God is on our side, too,

606
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:59,720
because he hates
the Yanks, huh, Blondie?

607
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,265
Blondie? Father,
is he still breathing?

608
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,559
Yes, of course.

609
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,394
TUCO: You're heavy.

610
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:18,990
There.

611
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,397
All right,
put a fresh
bandage on him.

612
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:54,525
Put him in my cell.

613
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:56,652
Easy.

614
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,366
PRIEST: Out, soldier.
Out you go. Come on.

615
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:05,369
Look out for him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

616
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,752
Hey, Father, I. . .

617
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,267
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

618
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,175
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about
anything, Father?

619
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:02,802
Oh, no, he hasn't
spoken as yet.

620
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:04,345
But you mustn't worry.

621
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,013
He's both young and strong.

622
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,432
That's what's kept
him going until now.

623
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,893
He should regain
his strength in
a very short time.

624
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:12,019
Thank you, Father.
Thank you.

625
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,604
You don't know how much
this boy's life means to me.

626
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,773
Thanks be to Jesus.
Thanks to all of you.

627
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,323
Blondie.

628
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,998
Hey, Blondie.

629
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,938
The old father tells me
you'll be up and
around in a few days.

630
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,776
You're very lucky
to have me so close
when it happened.

631
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,736
Think if you'd
been on your own.

632
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,157
Look, I mean, when. . .

633
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:50,951
When one is ill,

634
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:55,664
it's good to have
somebody close by,
friends or relations.

635
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:01,670
Do you have parents,
Blondie? A mother?

636
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:03,923
Not even a mother.

637
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:06,509
No one?

638
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,429
You're all alone, huh?
Like me, Blondie.

639
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,890
We're all alone
in the world.

640
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,227
I have you, you have me.

641
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,689
Only for
a little while, I mean.

642
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:23,442
It had to happen now.

643
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,654
What a dirty,
rotten trick of fate.

644
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:29,240
We could have all that
money in our hands.

645
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,833
I must tell you
the truth, Blondie.

646
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,293
In my place, you would
do the same thing.

647
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,506
It's all over for you now.

648
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,926
There's nothing
anyone can do anymore.

649
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:54,098
God help me. It's my fault.

650
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,350
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

651
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:09,947
I'll tell you
one thing, Blondie.

652
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:13,868
If I knew that
my last hour had come, I swear

653
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,246
in my place, in your place,
I would do the same thing.

654
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:21,542
I would tell
about the gold.
Yes. Yes, I would.

655
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:24,044
I'd tell the name
on the grave.

656
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,797
After all,
what good is the money
to you if you're dead?

657
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,716
I know the name
of the cemetery,

658
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,343
but you know
how many graves
there are there?

659
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,514
Please, Blondie.

660
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:41,729
Please, have a little, huh?
Here. Coffee.

661
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:43,647
Please, tell me the name

662
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,984
on the grave.

663
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:51,405
If I get my hands
on the $200,000,

664
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,117
I'll always
honor your memory.

665
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:59,288
I swear, I'll always
honor your memory.

666
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,959
(WHISPERS)
Come closer.

667
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,925
Tell me.

668
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,928
Why, you dirty. . .

669
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:18,515
I'll sleep better

670
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:23,604
knowing my good
friend is by my side

671
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,607
to protect me.

672
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,368
"Tuco, water."
Well, here's water.

673
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,704
But if I get
that name from you,
I'll give you water.

674
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:51,006
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

675
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,133
Come on, come on,
the party's over.

676
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,219
The wagon is
all ready to go.

677
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,137
From the way the wounded
are pouring into this place,

678
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,347
we better get
the hell out of here

679
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,516
before we get
caught up in the war.

680
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,767
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

681
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:02,935
Yeah.

682
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,062
This is something
I have to look into.

683
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,939
It'll only take
a minute. Get moving.

684
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:09,900
Where, this way?
Yes.

685
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:28,711
Hey, Pablo.

686
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:39,263
Don't you recognize me?

687
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,518
It's me, Tuco.
Let me embrace you.

688
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,025
I don't know
the right thing.

689
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:58,198
I was just passing by here,
I said to myself,

690
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,409
"I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother."

691
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:05,497
Did I do wrong?

692
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,960
It doesn't matter.
I'm very happy.

693
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:11,879
You have seen me, Tuco.

694
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:17,134
Yeah, well,
I'm very glad I came.

695
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:27,186
Oh, my uniform.
It's a long story.

696
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,689
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

697
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:33,067
You look very well.

698
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,069
A bit thin, perhaps, but

699
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,945
(LAUGHS)

700
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,490
you were always thin,
eh, Pablito?

701
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:44,369
What about our parents?

702
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,832
Only now do you
think of them.

703
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:52,169
To begin after nine years.

704
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,339
Nine years?

705
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:00,886
So it's nine years.
Nine years.

706
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,765
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

707
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:08,477
Our father died
only a few days ago.

708
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,563
That's why I was away.

709
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:17,152
He asked for you to be there,
but there was only me.

710
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:26,286
And you?

711
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,915
Outside of evil,
what else have
you managed to do?

712
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,128
It seems to me
you once had
a wife someplace.

713
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,758
Not one, lots of them.

714
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,136
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

715
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:46,181
Go on, preach me
a sermon, Pablo.

716
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:50,227
What good would that be?

717
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:54,231
Just keep on
the way you're going.

718
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:55,899
Go away.

719
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,318
And the Lord have
mercy on your soul.

720
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,444
Sure, I'll go, I'll go.

721
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:02,322
While I'm waiting
for the Lord
to remember me,

722
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:05,617
I, Tuco Ramirez,
brother of Brother Ramirez,

723
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:07,995
will tell you something.

724
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,164
You think you're
better than I am.

725
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,875
Where we came from,
if one didn't want
to die of poverty,

726
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,377
one became
a priest or a bandit.

727
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:18,005
You chose your way,
I chose mine.

728
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:19,840
Mine was harder!

729
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:21,550
You talk about
Mother and Father.

730
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:25,220
You remember, when you
left to become a priest,
I stayed behind.

731
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:29,183
I must have been 1 0, 1 2.
I don't remember which,
but I stayed.

732
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,685
I tried, but it was no good.

733
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,812
Now I will tell
you something.

734
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:37,566
You became a priest because
you were too much of a coward
to do what I do.

735
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:57,961
Tuco.

736
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,099
Please forgive me, brother.

737
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:42,339
My belly's full.

738
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,009
Nice guy, my brother.

739
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:49,221
I didn't tell you
my brother was
in charge here?

740
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:51,431
Everything.
Like the pope almost.

741
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:55,060
He's in charge in Rome.
Yeah, yeah, my brother,
he say to me,

742
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,979
"Stay, brother.
Don't go home.

743
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:58,855
"We never see each other.

744
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,443
"Here there's plenty
to eat and drink.
Bring your friend, too."

745
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,779
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

746
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:08,448
It's always the same story.

747
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:11,285
My brother,
he is crazy about me.

748
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:19,084
That's so.
Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens,

749
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:22,963
I know there's
a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me

750
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,548
a bowl of soup.

751
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:27,884
Sure.

752
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,223
Well, after a meal,
there's nothing
like a good cigar.

753
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:26,401
TUCO: Here's the
Sierra Magdalena.

754
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,738
Going this way,
we cross the Rio Grande.

755
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,532
That sure is a long way.

756
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:37,245
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas.

757
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:40,040
After that. . .
Then what?

758
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,543
When we get there,
I'll tell you.

759
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,212
You're not worried, are you?

760
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,302
Those men aren't worried
about anything anymore,
are they?

761
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:57,099
But since I'm alive
and I've noticed

762
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:00,727
we'll be crossing Yankee
and Confederate lines
a few times,

763
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:03,980
I thought you might
tell me where we're going.

764
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,566
Towards $200,000.

765
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,360
Is that good enough for you?

766
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:21,998
(GRUNTS)

767
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:30,215
Hey, wake up, you.

768
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:31,591
The troops are coming.
Come on.

769
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:33,051
Blue or gray?

770
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:43,979
They're gray like us.
Let's say "hello" to them
and then get going.

771
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:47,941
Hoorah ! Hoorah for
the Confederacy!

772
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:51,319
Hoorah !
Down with General Grant!

773
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:54,489
Hoorah for General. . .
What's his name?
Lee.

774
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,283
Lee! Lee!

775
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,495
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too!

776
01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:06,001
God's not on our side
'cause he hates idiots also.

777
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:22,142
SOLDIER:
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.

778
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:26,146
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.

779
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,815
Prisoners of war, forward

780
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,068
march !

781
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:25,580
Halt!

782
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,127
Left face!

783
01:32:34,423 --> 01:32:37,425
Form a single file. Move!

784
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,052
Jonathan Frost!

785
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:22,429
Present!

786
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:30,645
Richard McGilley!

787
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,105
Present!

788
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:33,607
Nathaniel Sullivan !

789
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,108
Present.

790
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:37,861
Robert Clark!

791
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,362
Present.

792
01:33:40,197 --> 01:33:41,281
Sam Richmond !

793
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:42,365
Present.

794
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:52,542
Bill Carson !

795
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,004
I said Bill Carson !

796
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:59,007
Hey, Blondie,
isn't that Angel Eyes?

797
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:02,636
SOLDIER: All right,
what's he doing, sleeping?

798
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:05,263
Bill Carson !

799
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:09,267
Yeah, and you
better be Bill Carson.

800
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,810
Bill Carson !

801
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:13,480
Yeah, that's me.

802
01:34:22,114 --> 01:34:23,907
Please, Carson,

803
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:27,202
answer "present."

804
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,789
What are you, deaf?

805
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,797
Now suppose you
say "present," Carson.

806
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:44,177
I like big
fat men like you.

807
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:46,096
When they fall,
they make more noise,

808
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,348
and sometimes
they never get up.

809
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,434
Wallace,

810
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,479
that's enough.

811
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:58,858
Sergeant!

812
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:03,113
The captain wants
to see you right away.

813
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,910
Be sure these two
get good treatment.

814
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:21,548
Hey, Blondie,
did you hear that?

815
01:35:21,632 --> 01:35:23,174
Good treatment.

816
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,095
Yeah.

817
01:35:30,349 --> 01:35:32,142
For the last time, Sergeant,

818
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:37,272
I'm telling you,
I want the prisoners
treated as prisoners.

819
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:39,482
No more brutality.

820
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:42,360
There's hundreds of
prisoners out there

821
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:44,571
and only a few
men to guard them.

822
01:35:44,655 --> 01:35:46,823
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.

823
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,368
I think that you'll manage
to gain their respect

824
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,746
by treating them better.

825
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,957
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

826
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:58,877
I don't give a God damn
what they do in Andersonville.

827
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:02,255
While I'm in charge here,
the prisoners are
not to be tortured,

828
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:05,383
or cheated or murdered.

829
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,677
That an accusation?

830
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:13,099
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

831
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:17,270
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed
systematically.

832
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:20,648
I know there's
scum around who are
bivouacked near the camp

833
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:23,359
waiting for someone
to deliver this loot.

834
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:28,698
But as long as I'm commandant,
I won't permit any
such trickery. Am I clear?

835
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:32,786
Yes.

836
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,662
Just as long as
you're the commandant.

837
01:36:36,999 --> 01:36:38,374
Yes, Sergeant.

838
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:44,672
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

839
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:49,302
but I pray I can manage
to have enough time
to amass evidence

840
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:51,638
and bring to a court-martial

841
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:57,060
all those who
discredit and dishonor
the uniform of the Union.

842
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,192
I wish you luck.

843
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:41,938
You and the others
better lay low
for a few days.

844
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,607
No, I'll keep this. You go.

845
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,359
Wallace will let you know.

846
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:59,664
Wallace, bring me Carson.

847
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:01,249
Right.

848
01:38:15,097 --> 01:38:19,017
Listen, Angel Eyes said
for us to lay low
for a few days,

849
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:22,520
but we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

850
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:24,147
Come on, saddle your horses.

851
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,316
Get in.

852
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:31,988
(DOOR LOCKS)

853
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:38,369
ANGEL EYES: Come on in, Tuco.
Don't be bashful.

854
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:41,748
There's no
formalities here.

855
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,636
It's been a long time.

856
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:01,935
You're hungry.
Sit down, eat.

857
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:23,456
I knew it, I knew it.

858
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:27,961
The minute I saw you,
I said to myself,

859
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:31,631
"Look at that pig,
Angel Eyes.

860
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:34,884
"I'll bet he got
himself an easy job,

861
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:40,640
"and he never
forgets a friend."

862
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,726
I never forget
old friends, Tuco.

863
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,647
Right.

864
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:49,273
It's good to see
old friends again.

865
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,860
Good.

866
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:55,405
Especially when they've
come from so far away

867
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:58,366
and have so much
to talk about.

868
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,121
And you do have
a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

869
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,751
You were captured
near Fort Craig.

870
01:40:13,632 --> 01:40:15,341
Well, if you were
with Sibley, that means then

871
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:18,052
that you were coming
from Santa Fe.

872
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:33,693
Was it hard
crossing the desert?

873
01:40:33,777 --> 01:40:35,570
Mmm-Hmm. Very hard.

874
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,615
Especially if you don't
have anything to drink.

875
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:44,954
Why are you going
under the name of
Bill Carson now?

876
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,838
One name is as
good as another.

877
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:55,631
Not wise to use
your own name.

878
01:40:56,925 --> 01:40:58,092
Like you.

879
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:00,136
I'll bet they don't
call you Angel Eyes.

880
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,222
Sergeant Angel Eyes.

881
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,474
(LAUGHS)

882
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,401
Like a little music
with your meal, Tuco?

883
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:19,655
Music? Yes, it's very good,
very good for the digestion.

884
01:41:33,295 --> 01:41:34,462
So. . .

885
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:38,049
Bill Carson's
a fake name, huh?

886
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:44,972
That fake, too?

887
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:49,393
Bill Carson's name's
written in it.

888
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:54,982
Have some.
It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

892
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:30,244
What'd he tell you
about the money?

893

(CHOKING) I don't. . .

894

you're talking about.

More feeling.

You can sure
consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:24,090
So many of us have
had a session in there.

900
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:47,863
How's your digestion now?

901
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,786
You'd better talk.

902
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,122
I have nothing to tell you.

903
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,359
Play that fiddle, you.

TUCO: Enough.
Enough. I talk. I talk.

906
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,126
What did he say
about the money?

907
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:30,591
It's buried in a grave.

908
01:46:31,968 --> 01:46:33,386
Where?

909
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,887
Sad Hill.

910
01:46:34,971 --> 01:46:37,431
Sad Hill Cemetery.

911
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:41,685
Which grave?

912
01:46:42,729 --> 01:46:46,357
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

913
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:51,987
Blondie.
Ask Blondie.

914
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,615
He knows the name
on the grave.

915
01:47:16,721 --> 01:47:18,389
Put those clothes on.

916
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,437
Why?

917
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:26,021
We're going for a ride.

918
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:28,732
Where?

919
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:30,484
To find $200,000.

920
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:34,947
I know the name of
the cemetery now,

921
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:37,408
and you know
the name of the grave.

922
01:47:57,554 --> 01:48:00,556
You're not gonna give me
the same treatment?

923
01:48:04,394 --> 01:48:05,436
Would you talk?

924
01:48:07,063 --> 01:48:08,481
No, probably not.

925
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:12,151
That's what I thought.

926
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:15,321
Not that you're any
tougher than Tuco,

927
01:48:15,405 --> 01:48:18,407
but you're smart
enough to know that
talking won't save you.

928
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:25,539
And Tuco, is he. . .

929
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:29,752
No. Not yet.

very good hands.

but you still
got the same deal.

I'm only taking half.

There's two of us.

934
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:45,351
It should make it
easier than just one.

01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:51,941
Yeah.

936
01:49:12,003 --> 01:49:15,589
Hold it.
That's it, don't move.

937

Now don't breathe.
Still. That's it.

Got it. Thank you.

That's a lot of
money for a head.

didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

if I ever get you down,

you're gonna need

to get up again. A lot.

and you're all finished.

any partner this time
to shoot you down.

out a plan.

1110
02:17:51,137 --> 02:17:52,513
I sure have.

1111
02:17:53,848 --> 02:17:56,767
The best time is
after the attack

1112
02:17:56,851 --> 02:17:59,812
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

1113
02:18:00,939 --> 02:18:05,526
If I could do it,
I could save many
thousands of men.

1114
02:18:11,199 --> 02:18:13,367
But what I lack
is the guts.

1115

They're beginning
their daily slaughter
right on time.

1116
02:18:22,585 --> 02:18:26,130
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

1117
02:18:26,214 --> 02:18:27,589
Be right there.

1118
02:18:41,229 --> 02:18:42,563
Let's go.

1119
02:18:43,606 --> 02:18:47,443
All right, friends,
come along and
enjoy the spectacle.

Hey, Blondie,

1128
02:20:01,226 --> 02:20:04,061
it looks like the captain
is really asking for
a bullet in his guts.

1129
02:20:04,145 --> 02:20:05,312
Yeah.

1130
02:20:58,783 --> 02:21:01,702
I've never seen
so many men
wasted so badly.

1131
02:21:22,432 --> 02:21:26,059
I have a feeling
it's really gonna be
a good, long battle.

1132
02:21:30,231 --> 02:21:31,899
Blondie?
Huh?

1133
02:21:32,567 --> 02:21:34,776
The money's on
the other side
of the river.

1134
02:21:36,571 --> 02:21:37,779
Where?

1135
02:21:40,408 --> 02:21:43,577
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

1136
02:21:44,454 --> 02:21:47,498
But while
the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

1137
02:21:49,167 --> 02:21:52,836
What would happen
if somebody were
to blow up that bridge?

1138
02:21:54,547 --> 02:21:55,672
Yeah.

1139
02:21:56,758 --> 02:21:59,510
Then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight.

1140
02:22:00,386 --> 02:22:01,595
Maybe.

1141
02:22:39,634 --> 02:22:42,177
SOLDIER: Doctor, quick,
the captain's wounded.

1142
02:22:44,931 --> 02:22:46,682
Hurry, a stretcher.

1143
02:22:49,102 --> 02:22:50,644
Easy. Easy now.

1144

Get things ready.

1145
02:23:24,220 --> 02:23:25,470
A little of this will help.

1146
02:23:32,687 --> 02:23:34,521
Take a slug of this, Captain.

1147

What are you doing?
No, leave me alone.

1150
02:26:08,134 --> 02:26:11,928
Blondie, you realize
we might be risking our lives.

1151
02:26:12,805 --> 02:26:15,056
Yeah, and if I get killed,

1152
02:26:15,141 --> 02:26:18,518
you'll never get your hands
on all that beautiful money.

1153
02:26:18,603 --> 02:26:20,103
Yeah, Tuco,

1154
02:26:21,355 --> 02:26:22,856
it sure would be a pity.

Doctor,

1157
02:26:59,143 --> 02:27:01,228
could you help me
live a little more?

I expect good news.

1159

Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

No, I think
it's better that

you start.

1164

All right.

The name of
the cemetery is. . .

Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

Arch Stanton.

1169

Arch Stanton?
Are you sure?

easier with that.

1173

Two can dig a lot
quicker than one.

1174

you won't see
a cent of that money.

I'll tell you why.

nothing in there.

to get me killed?
